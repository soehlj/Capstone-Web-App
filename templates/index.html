		<h1>Casting with 3D Prints</h1>
		<p>3D Printing is an immensely useful technology that can produce complex objects with ease. However, there are certain limitations to the types of materials available for 3D printing and their properties. This page acts as a guide to our project which is focussed on finding the optimal solution to create casting molds with 3D printing.</p>
