		<h1>Casting with 3D Prints</h1>

		<p>
			3D Printing is an immensely useful technology that can produce complex objects with ease.
			However, there are limitations to materials and their properties.
			This page acts as a guide to our project which focuses on finding the optimal solution for
			creating casting molds with 3D printing.
