 -- INSTALLING PROGRAMS -- 
 To do the linting process, we are using the formatter Black and the
linter Pylint.

To install these programs, run the following code:
python -m venv venv
source ./venv/Scripts/activate
pip install black pylint

 -- Formatting with Black --
To run the formatter, treat a file (you can also use a directory) like
you were going to run it with python, but type 'black' instead of 'python'

example
black app.py

the formatter will automatically format the code in the file.

 -- Linting with Pylint--
same process as with black, just run pylint <file>. This will output
notes and errors from the code. Note that some errors might not need
adjustment.

example
pylint app.py
